      <TT

      have seen a notice like this flying by:

      That means you have to rebuild (part of) your Python
      installation to supply this shared library.

      maintainers do not provide any direct way to do this.  The

TARGET="_top"
>Python FAQ
      3.30</A
>.  On some operating systems you don't really have
      to build a shared library, but then you will have to convince
      the <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> build system of this.  Consult
      the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>Makefile</TT

   65 MB for the source tree during compilation and about 15 MB for
   the installation directory. An empty database cluster takes about
   25 MB, databases take about five times the amount of space that a
   flat text file with the same data would take. If you are going to
   run the regression tests you will temporarily need up to an extra
   90 MB. Use the <TT
