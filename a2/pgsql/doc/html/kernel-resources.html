    possible that this limit has been exceeded. The size of the required

    buffers (<TT
CLASS="OPTION"
>-B</TT

    (<TT
CLASS="OPTION"
>-N</TT
> option), although the former is the most significant.
    (You can, as a temporary solution, lower these settings to eliminate
    the failure.) As a rough approximation, you can estimate the
    required segment size by multiplying the number of buffers and the
    block size (8 kB by default) plus ample overhead (at least half a
    megabyte). Any error message you might get will contain the size of
    the failed allocation request.
   </P
><P
>    Less likely to cause problems is the minimum size for shared

    approximately 256 kB for <SPAN

    (<TT

    not cause a problem unless your system has them set to zero. Some

    contain a 17th semaphore which contains a <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"

    other applications. The maximum number of semaphores in the system
    is set by <TT

CLASS="VARNAME"
>SEMMNI</TT

    determines the limit on the number of semaphore sets that can
    exist on the system at one time.  Hence this parameter must be at
    least <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"

    resource map, in which each contiguous block of available semaphores
    needs an entry. When a semaphore set is freed it is either added to
    an existing entry that is adjacent to the freed block or it is
    registered under a new map entry. If the map is full, the freed
    semaphores get lost (until reboot). Fragmentation of the semaphore
    space could over time lead to fewer available semaphores than there
    should be.

    importance are limits on the number of processes per user, the
    number of open files per process, and the amount of memory available
    to each process. Each of these have a <SPAN

    <SPAN

    but it can be changed by the user up to the hard limit. The hard
    limit can only be changed by the root user. The system call
    <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"

    parameters. The shell's built-in command <TT
