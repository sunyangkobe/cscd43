   <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"

> under the data directory, as a set of
   segment files, each 16 MB in size.  Each segment is divided into 8
   kB pages. The log record headers are described in
   <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>access/xlog.h</TT
>; the record content is dependent
   on the type of event that is being logged.  Segment files are given
   ever-increasing numbers as names, starting at
   <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>0000000000000000</TT
>.  The numbers do not wrap, at
   present, but it should take a very long time to exhaust the
   available stock of numbers.

>   The <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>WAL</ACRONYM
> buffers and control structure are in
   shared memory and are handled by the server child processes; they
   are protected by lightweight locks.  The demand on shared memory is
   dependent on the number of buffers.  The default size of the
   <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>WAL</ACRONYM
> buffers is 8 buffers of 8 kB each, or 64 kB
   total.
  </P
><P
>   It is of advantage if the log is located on another disk than the
   main database files.  This may be achieved by moving the directory
   <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>pg_xlog</TT
> to another location (while the server
   is shut down, of course) and creating a symbolic link from the
   original location in the main data directory to the new location.
  </P
><P
>   The aim of <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>WAL</ACRONYM
>, to ensure that the log is
   written before database records are altered, may be subverted by
   disk drives<A
NAME="AEN19693"
></A
> that falsely report a successful write to the kernel,
   when, in fact, they have only cached the data and not yet stored it
   on the disk.  A power failure in such a situation may still lead to
   irrecoverable data corruption.  Administrators should try to ensure
   that disks holding <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
>'s
   <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>WAL</ACRONYM
> log files do not make such false reports.
  </P

>   After a checkpoint has been made and the log flushed, the
   checkpoint's position is saved in the file
   <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>pg_control</TT
>. Therefore, when recovery is to be
   done, the server first reads <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>pg_control</TT
> and
   then the checkpoint record; then it performs the REDO operation by
   scanning forward from the log position indicated in the checkpoint
   record.  Because the entire content of data pages is saved in the
   log on the first page modification after a checkpoint, all pages
   changed since the checkpoint will be restored to a consistent
   state.
  </P
><P
>   Using <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>pg_control</TT
> to get the checkpoint
   position speeds up the recovery process, but to handle possible
   corruption of <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>pg_control</TT
>, we should actually
   implement the reading of existing log segments in reverse order --
   newest to oldest -- in order to find the last checkpoint.  This has
   not been implemented, yet.
