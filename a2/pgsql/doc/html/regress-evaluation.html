>     If you run the tests against an already-installed server that was
     initialized with a collation-order locale other than C, then
     there may be differences due to sort order and follow-up
     failures.  The regression test suite is set up to handle this
     problem by providing alternative result files that together are
     known to handle a large number of locales.  For example, for the
     <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>char</TT
> test, the expected file
     <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>char.out</TT
> handles the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"

> and <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>POSIX</TT
> locales,
     and the file <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>char_1.out</TT
> handles many other
     locales.  The regression test driver will automatically pick the
     best file to match against when checking for success and for
     computing failure differences.  (This means that the regression
     tests cannot detect whether the results are appropriate for the
     configured locale.  The tests will simply pick the one result
     file that works best.)

>testname</I

     The actual digit is not significant.  Remember that the
     regression test driver will consider all such files to be equally
     valid test results.  If the test results are platform-specific,
     the technique described in <A

>You might see differences in which the same rows are output in a

this is not, strictly speaking, a bug.  Most of the regression test
scripts are not so pedantic as to use an <TT

>ORDER BY</TT

<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"

according to the letter of the SQL specification.  In practice, since we are
looking at the same queries being executed on the same data by the same
software, we usually get the same result ordering on all platforms, and
so the lack of <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>ORDER BY</TT

cross-platform ordering differences, however.  (Ordering differences
can also be triggered by non-C locale settings.)
    </P

>Therefore, if you see an ordering difference, it's not something to
worry about, unless the query does have an <TT

<TT

>You might wonder why we don't order all the regression test queries explicitly to
get rid of this issue once and for all.  The reason is that that would
make the regression tests less useful, not more, since they'd tend
to exercise query plan types that produce ordered results to the
exclusion of those that don't.
