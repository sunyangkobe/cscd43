>    The UNDO operation is not implemented. This means that changes
    made by aborted transactions will still occupy disk space and that
    a permanent <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>pg_clog</TT
> file to hold
    the status of transactions is still needed, since
    transaction identifiers cannot be reused. Once UNDO is implemented,
    <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>pg_clog</TT
> will no longer be required to be
    permanent; it will be possible to remove
    <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>pg_clog</TT
> at shutdown. (However, the urgency of
    this concern has decreased greatly with the adoption of a segmented
    storage method for <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>pg_clog</TT
>: it is no longer
    necessary to keep old <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>pg_clog</TT
> entries around
    forever.)
   </P
><P
>    With UNDO, it will also be possible to implement
    <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>savepoints</I
><A
NAME="AEN19605"
></A
> to allow partial rollback of
    invalid transaction operations (parser errors caused by mistyping
    commands, insertion of duplicate primary/unique keys and so on)
    with the ability to continue or commit valid operations made by
    the transaction before the error.  At present, any error will
    invalidate the whole transaction and require a transaction abort.

>    <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>WAL</ACRONYM
> offers the opportunity for a new method for
    database on-line backup and restore (<ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>BAR</ACRONYM
>).  To
    use this method, one would have to make periodic saves of data
    files to another disk, a tape or another host and also archive the
    <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>WAL</ACRONYM
> log files.  The database file copy and the
    archived log files could be used to restore just as if one were
    restoring after a crash. Each time a new database file copy was
    made the old log files could be removed.  Implementing this
    facility will require the logging of data file and index creation
    and deletion; it will also require development of a method for
    copying the data files (operating system copy commands are not
    suitable).
   </P
><P
>    A difficulty standing in the way of realizing these benefits is that
    they require saving <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>WAL</ACRONYM
> entries for considerable
    periods of time (e.g., as long as the longest possible transaction if
    transaction UNDO is wanted). The present <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>WAL</ACRONYM
>
    format is extremely bulky since it includes many disk page
    snapshots. This is not a serious concern at present, since the
    entries only need to be kept for one or two checkpoint intervals;
    but to achieve these future benefits some sort of compressed
    <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>WAL</ACRONYM
> format will be needed.
