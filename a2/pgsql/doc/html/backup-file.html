>   An alternative backup strategy is to directly copy the files that
   <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> uses to store the data in the database. In
   <A
HREF="creating-cluster.html"
>Section 16.2</A
> it is explained where these files
   are located, but you have probably found them already if you are
   interested in this method. You can use whatever method you prefer
   for doing usual file system backups, for example

   method:

>      The database server <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>must</I
></SPAN
> be shut down in order to
      get a usable backup. Half-way measures such as disallowing all
      connections will not work as there is always some buffering
      going on. For this reason it is also not advisable to trust file
      systems that claim to support <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"consistent
      snapshots"</SPAN
>. Information about stopping the server can be
      found in <A
HREF="postmaster-shutdown.html"
>Section 16.6</A
>.  Needless to say
      that you also need to shut down the server before restoring the
      data.

><P
>      If you have dug into the details of the file system layout of the data you
      may be tempted to try to back up or restore only certain
      individual tables or databases from their respective files or
      directories. This will <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>not</I
></SPAN
> work because the
      information contained in these files contains only half the
      truth. The other half is in the commit log files
      <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>pg_clog/*</TT
>, which contain the commit status of
      all transactions. A table file is only usable with this
      information. Of course it is also impossible to restore only a
      table and the associated <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>pg_clog</TT
> data
      because that would render all other tables in the database
      cluster useless.

  </P
><P
>   An alternative file-system backup approach is to make a
   <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"consistent snapshot"</SPAN
> of the data directory, if the
   file system supports that functionality.  Such a snapshot will save
   the database files in a state where the database server was not
   properly shut down; therefore, when you start the database server
   on this backed up directory, it will think the server had crashed
   and replay the WAL log.  This is not a problem, just be aware of
   it.

>   Note that the file system backup will not necessarily be
   smaller than an SQL dump. On the contrary, it will most likely be
   larger. (<SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>pg_dump</SPAN
> does not need to dump
   the contents of indexes for example, just the commands to recreate
   them.)
