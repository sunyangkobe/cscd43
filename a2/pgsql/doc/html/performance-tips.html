    the cost of all its child nodes.  It's also important to realize that
    the cost only reflects things that the planner/optimizer cares about.
    In particular, the cost does not consider the time spent transmitting
    result rows to the frontend, which could be a pretty dominant
    factor in the true elapsed time; but the planner ignores it because
    it cannot change it by altering the plan.  (Every correct plan will
    output the same row set, we trust.)

CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM tenk1;

                         QUERY PLAN
-------------------------------------------------------------
 Seq Scan on tenk1  (cost=0.00..333.00 rows=10000 width=148)</PRE
><P>
   </P
><P
>    This is about as straightforward as it gets.  If you do

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>SELECT * FROM pg_class WHERE relname = 'tenk1';</PRE
><P>

    you will find out that <CODE
CLASS="CLASSNAME"
>tenk1</CODE
> has 233 disk
    pages and 10000 rows.  So the cost is estimated at 233 page
    reads, defined as costing 1.0 apiece, plus 10000 * <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>cpu_tuple_cost</TT
> which is
    currently 0.01 (try <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>SHOW cpu_tuple_cost</TT
>).
   </P
><P
>    Now let's modify the query to add a <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>WHERE</TT
> condition:

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM tenk1 WHERE unique1 &lt; 1000;

                         QUERY PLAN
------------------------------------------------------------
 Seq Scan on tenk1  (cost=0.00..358.00 rows=1033 width=148)
   Filter: (unique1 &lt; 1000)</PRE
><P>

    The estimate of output rows has gone down because of the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>WHERE</TT
> clause.
    However, the scan will still have to visit all 10000 rows, so the cost
    hasn't decreased; in fact it has gone up a bit to reflect the extra CPU
    time spent checking the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>WHERE</TT
> condition.
   </P
><P
>    The actual number of rows this query would select is 1000, but the
    estimate is only approximate.  If you try to duplicate this experiment,
    you will probably get a slightly different estimate; moreover, it will
    change after each <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ANALYZE</TT
> command, because the
    statistics produced by <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ANALYZE</TT
> are taken from a
    randomized sample of the table.
   </P
><P
>    Modify the query to restrict the condition even more:

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM tenk1 WHERE unique1 &lt; 50;

                                   QUERY PLAN
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Index Scan using tenk1_unique1 on tenk1  (cost=0.00..179.33 rows=49 width=148)
   Index Cond: (unique1 &lt; 50)</PRE
><P>

    and you will see that if we make the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>WHERE</TT
> condition selective
    enough, the planner will
    eventually decide that an index scan is cheaper than a sequential scan.
    This plan will only have to visit 50 rows because of the index,
    so it wins despite the fact that each individual fetch is more expensive
    than reading a whole disk page sequentially.
   </P
><P
>    Add another condition to the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>WHERE</TT
> clause:

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM tenk1 WHERE unique1 &lt; 50 AND stringu1 = 'xxx';

                                  QUERY PLAN
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Index Scan using tenk1_unique1 on tenk1  (cost=0.00..179.45 rows=1 width=148)
   Index Cond: (unique1 &lt; 50)
   Filter: (stringu1 = 'xxx'::name)</PRE
><P>

    The added condition <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>stringu1 = 'xxx'</TT
> reduces the
    output-rows estimate, but not the cost because we still have to visit the
    same set of rows.  Notice that the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>stringu1</TT
> clause
    cannot be applied as an index condition (since this index is only on
    the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>unique1</TT
> column).  Instead it is applied as a filter on
    the rows retrieved by the index.  Thus the cost has actually gone up
    a little bit to reflect this extra checking.
   </P
><P
>    Let's try joining two tables, using the columns we have been discussing:

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM tenk1 t1, tenk2 t2 WHERE t1.unique1 &lt; 50 AND t1.unique2 = t2.unique2;

                               QUERY PLAN

         Index Cond: ("outer".unique2 = t2.unique2)</PRE
><P>
   </P
><P
>    In this nested-loop join, the outer scan is the same index scan we had
    in the example before last, and so its cost and row count are the same
    because we are applying the <TT

> clause <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>unique1 &lt; 50</TT
> at that node.
    The <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>t1.unique2 = t2.unique2</TT

    affect row count of the outer scan.  For the inner scan, the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>unique2</TT

    current
    outer-scan row is plugged into the inner index scan
    to produce an index condition like
    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>t2.unique2 = <TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>constant</I
></TT
></TT

     same inner-scan plan and costs that we'd get from, say, <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>EXPLAIN SELECT
     * FROM tenk2 WHERE unique2 = 42</TT
>.  The costs of the loop node are then set
     on the basis of the cost of the outer scan, plus one repetition of the
     inner scan for each outer row (49 * 3.01, here), plus a little CPU
     time for join processing.
   </P
><P
>    In this example the join's output row count is the same as the product
    of the two scans' row counts, but that's not true in general, because
    in general you can have <TT

> clauses that mention both tables and
    so can only be applied at the join point, not to either input scan.
    For example, if we added <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>WHERE ... AND t1.hundred &lt; t2.hundred</TT
>,
    that would decrease the output row count of the join node, but not change
    either input scan.

    This plan proposes to extract the 50 interesting rows of <CODE
CLASS="CLASSNAME"
>tenk1</CODE
>
    using ye same olde index scan, stash them into an in-memory hash table,
    and then do a sequential scan of <CODE
CLASS="CLASSNAME"

>, probing into the hash table
    for possible matches of <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>t1.unique2 = t2.unique2</TT
> at each <CODE
CLASS="CLASSNAME"
>tenk2</CODE
> row.
    The cost to read <CODE
CLASS="CLASSNAME"
>tenk1</CODE
> and set up the hash table is entirely start-up
    cost for the hash join, since we won't get any rows out until we can
    start reading <CODE
CLASS="CLASSNAME"
>tenk2</CODE
>.  The total time estimate for the join also
    includes a hefty charge for the CPU time to probe the hash table
    10000 times.  Note, however, that we are <SPAN

    The planner's cost estimates are not linear and so it may well choose
    a different plan for a larger or smaller table.  An extreme example
    is that on a table that only occupies one disk page, you'll nearly
    always get a sequential scan plan whether indexes are available or not.
    The planner realizes that it's going to take one disk page read to
    process the table in any case, so there's no value in expending additional
    page reads to look at an index.
